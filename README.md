# StockHawk
Udacity Project 3

Why this Project?
Stock Hawk gives you an opportunity to diagnose problems and practice improving apps. These skills are vital to building apps users will love.

Diagnosing issues with existing apps is key to working on large apps or continuing projects in Android. Being aware of the common pitfalls in app design frees a developer to produce novel app experiences without making the same mistakes over and over.

What Will I Learn?
In this project, you will:

Diagnose existing issues with an app.
Make an app accessible to sight-impaired users.
Allow your app to be localized for distribution in other countries.
Handle error cases in Android.
Add a widget to your app experience.
Leverage the functionality of a library in your app.
Required Tasks
Download the app code from the Stock Hawk repository on GitHub.
Read the UX Review in the next node.
Spend time exploring the current state of the app, looking for ways they could be improved. Be sure to look specifically at issues called out in the UX Review.
Execute the improvements!
Note about google-services.json - To avoid seeing the error "GoogleService failed to initialize, status: 10" you should create a google-services.json file. You can generate one here. This file should not be included in your submission.
